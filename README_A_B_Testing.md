# 📊 Marketing A/B Testing: Conversion Optimization Case Study

## 1. 🏢 About the Project

This project explores a real-world marketing A/B testing scenario, where a company tests two variations of a web page (Control vs Treatment) to understand which version leads to higher user conversions. Using statistical testing, the goal is to determine if observed differences in conversion rates are significant enough to influence a business decision.

---

## 2. 📌 Problem Statement

The marketing team suspects that a new version of the webpage might improve conversion rates. They randomly split users into two groups — control and treatment — and record their conversion behavior.

---

## 3. 🎯 Objective

- Load and clean experimental A/B testing data.
- Calculate conversion rates for control and treatment groups.
- Run statistical hypothesis testing (Z-test or test of proportions).
- Determine if the treatment led to statistically significant improvements.

---

## 4. 📚 Concepts and Tools Used

- **Data Cleaning & Exploration**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Statistical Testing**: Two-proportion Z-test
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Experiment Analysis**: Hypothesis formulation, p-value interpretation

---

## 5. 🔍 Key Findings

- **Conversion Rate - Control**: X.XX%
- **Conversion Rate - Treatment**: Y.YY%
- Statistical test results:
  - **p-value**: ZZZ
  - **Conclusion**: [Reject/Fail to reject] the null hypothesis

---

## 6. 🧠 Business Insights

- The test provides a statistically valid recommendation on whether the new version should be rolled out platform-wide.
- Understanding conversion uplift can drive revenue improvements.
- A/B testing is a vital tool in product experimentation cycles.

---

## 7. ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete A/B testing workflow from data import to actionable decision-making using statistical rigor. The same process is widely applicable in product, marketing, and operations analytics roles.
